# Data

In this folder we will post data, and links to data, from the Coronavirus outbreak. Some of these datasets will be formatted
for the suggested analyses within each theme. Some will be extra datasets for which we do not have a goal in mind, but may come 
in useful depending on the ideas and direction of each group. Of course, participants are also welcome to find and incorporate
new data sources!

### Line lists:

[Kudos line list data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jS24DjSPVWa4iuxuD4OAXrE3QeI8c9BC1hSlqr-NMiU/edit#gid=1187587451). Compiled list of cases with lots of info (524 cases as of 13/02). Definition of a 'confirmed' case is unclear. Backer et al used this in their analysis. Maintained by Dr. Kaiyuan Sun (NIH, USA)

[nCoV line list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1itaohdPiAeniCXNlntNztZ_oRvjh0HsGuJXUJWET008/edit#gid=0). Another line list dataset, inside and outside Hubei province. 


### Case counts:

[China province data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gTj4zFMfXRk92CCQAOwa04ZBhqJ4oSmQFm_nb8-YXbw/edit#gid=0). Cases per province per day. 

[Read et al Github](https://github.com/chrism0dwk/wuhan). Github repo with code for Read et al analysis. Contains case count data for China and international, but missing flight data from OAG traffic analyzer for licensing reasons. It is not clear why they list relatively few cases in Wuhan (74 on Jan 22, 0 on Jan 23 and 24).

[Johns Hopkins IDD team data](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). Case count data, which we have [digitized here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbC12F9_WlJNBafwM7uwli0jhT3v_jlCL0dqukAjfJM/edit#gid=0) up to 05/02. 

[JHU CSSE data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQVypefm946ch4XDp37uZ-wartW4V7ILdg-qYiDXUHM/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true#). Case count data curated by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Someone has formatted this to [csv on Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset), and as of 11/02 the JHU team is making the data available on [Github here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

### Travel data

[Tencent’s LBS (location-based services) database](https://heat.qq.com/). The daily number of Chinese domestic passengers by means of air, train and road transportation, recorded by Tencent’s LBS database. Used in the Wu et al analysis. **However** this website is written in Chinese! If anyone is willing to translate and extract the data this would be excellent.  

### Other data

[Wu et al (2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext#seccestitle150) and [supplementary information](https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9/attachment/f77f1dc7-43a5-4d5e-a709-5cf061abdfdc/mmc1.pdf). Contains various data tables of line list data, social and personal non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in China, and relevant information from SARS and MERS.
