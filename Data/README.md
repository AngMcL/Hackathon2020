# Data

In this folder we will post data, and links to data, from the Coronavirus outbreak. Some of these datasets will be formatted
for the suggested analyses within each theme. Some will be extra datasets for which we do not have a goal in mind, but may come 
in useful depending on the ideas and direction of each group. Of course, participants are also welcome to find and incorporate
new data sources!

Definition of a 'confirmed' case is unclear. Backer et al used this in their analysis. Maintained by Dr. Kaiyuan Sun (NIH, USA)

[nCoV line list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1itaohdPiAeniCXNlntNztZ_oRvjh0HsGuJXUJWET008/edit#gid=0). Another line list dataset, inside and outside Hubei province. 


### Case counts:

[China province data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gTj4zFMfXRk92CCQAOwa04ZBhqJ4oSmQFm_nb8-YXbw/edit#gid=0). Cases per province per day. 

[Read et al Github](https://github.com/chrism0dwk/wuhan). Github repo with code for Read et al analysis. Contains case count data for China and international, but missing flight data from OAG traffic analyzer for licensing reasons.
