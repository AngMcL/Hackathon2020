# Data

In this folder we will post data, and links to data, from the Coronavirus outbreak. Some of these datasets will be formatted
for the suggested analyses within each theme. Some will be extra datasets for which we do not have a goal in mind, but may come 
in useful depending on the ideas and direction of each group. Of course, participants are also welcome to find and incorporate
new data sources!
