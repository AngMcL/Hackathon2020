# Estimate Outbreak Parameters

## Introduction

## Some analyses of this outbreak, where code is available or feasible to write

[Imperial College London's MRC Centre for Outbreak analysis reports 1 and 2](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-2019-nCoV-transmissibility.pdf). These reports investigate the under-reporting of nCoV cases in Wuhan city. Using a probabilistic approach, they infer the 'true' number of nCoV cases within Wuhan City that may have occurred by 2 given dates, by assuming the number of cases detected outside China is fully observed. The only data required is that included in the report. It would be interesting to explore and test their assumptions, or to create more up-to-date estimates using recent case count data.

[Imperial College London's MRC Centre for Outbreak analysis report 4](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf). This report estimates the case fatality rate (CFR) of coronavirus cases in Hubei province, elsewhere in China, and internationally. Using a Bayesian approach, they estimate the disease onset-to-recovery time and onset-to-death time distributions. They continue to estimate the CFR using a stastistical model. Required data is linked at the end of the report.
